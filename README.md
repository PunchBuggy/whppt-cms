# Whppt - CMS

## Whppt - Background
Whppt comes from the need to have an easy to use CMS that can be easily added to javascript projects. We aim to use modern tools and allow for many different customer needs. We have been using an online version of Whppt on our own projects for a while and now have the need for customers to run and maintain it internally. So here we are open sourcing it. We hope it helps someone else out there and always appreciate any constructive feedback.

We have a long way to go but are excited about what Whppt will be in the future.

# Whppt - Online
Whppt is available an online solution but is not yet available for public registrations. If you are interested please contact us: support@sveltestudios.com
